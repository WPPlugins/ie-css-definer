Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: 1.2

== Description ==

ie CSS definer allows you to define CSS code meant for specific versions of internet explorer. This allows on the fly editing and fine tuning of certain design anomalies that are common with internet explorer. Using commented conditionals that ie reads and understands, one can now target a range of versions or even a specific version of internet explorer to apply the custom css fixes. This saves a great deal of time as extra separate css files are cumbersome and appear to be a chore when small fixes are needed. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload ie-css-definer folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory OR through wp-admin,
upload ie-css-definer.zip in plugin 'Add New' page.
3. CSS definitions can be defined under Tools > iE CSS Definer.
